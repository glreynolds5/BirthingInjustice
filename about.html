<div class="aboutDesc" id="desc">
<p>Black neonates suffer from one of the largest inequalities in health care and health outcomes than any other group in the United States. 
   The disparities and inequalities seen in Black infants are a reflection on the mother’s life from birth to maternal age taking into account chronic stressors and racism experienced throughout her life. 
   Racial justice must be thought of more than a political stance or rights for all Americans. 
   Racism is a public health crisis that unnecessarily claims thousands of African American infants every year with the cause being wrongly attributed to lack of education or genetic differences. 
   Dr. Gilbert Gee and other researchers are echoing the generational sentiment that an infant’s health is not independent of its mother’s and the lived experiences of her racial classification play a key role in both of their health (Gee et al., 2012).</p>
